Portability in its ability to be used on multiple platforms due to its dependency free design, and embeddability in its ability to be integrated with an existing Go project or used as a standalone programming language.</p><br><p>The value of Wyltl is that its portability allows developers to use Wyltl to extend their existing Go projects or create new ones without worrying about platform support, and its embeddability allows developers implement their application logic using Wyltl or create applications with Wyltl itself! Wyltl follows a prose like syntax allowing it to be read and understood easily and uses clear syntactical and semantical rules.</p><br><p>Wyltlâ€™s dependency free design provides it compatibility with the embedded Go compiler, allowing Wyltl applications to be ported to a variety of architectures with little effort. The implementation of Wyltl is two-fold, consisting of an interpreter and a compiler.</p><br><p>The interpreter is easily extendable but has slow execution speed. The compiler is more complex for a user to extend, as it must convert Wyltl code to bytecode and execute it in a virtual machine, however it is faster.</p><br><p>Wyltl provides benefits to both experienced and beginner programmers. Experienced programmers gain the benefit of having a language they can embed within their applications and easily extend as needed. Beginners benefit by having a language that provides them with common procedural programming features and is created with ease of use in mind.</section><section><br><br><h1 style=text-align:center>Created by Dineth Mallawarachchi</h1><br><br></section></div>
